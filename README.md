# test-protect-branch

This is a Node.js project set up with TypeScript. It uses Express for handling HTTP requests and Jest for running tests. The project is configured with GitHub Actions for continuous integration, running tests on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.

The application's entry point is `src/index.ts`, which sets up an Express server and routes. The server's port is configured through environment variables.

Tests for the application are located in the `tests/` directory. The project is also configured to generate test coverage reports.

For development, the project uses `nodemon` for hot-reloading and `concurrently` for running multiple npm scripts concurrently.

Please refer to the `package.json` file for the full list of scripts and dependencies.
